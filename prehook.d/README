Util/prehook.d/

Some Util packages may need to deposit a file here. Each file in this directory will be executed at each logon.
NOTE: Unlike include.d/, it is highly recommended to keep your additions to prehook.d/ to a single file.
All Util prehook files are bash scripts with the file extension .util-prehook. The system will ignore
any other files or directories placed here.
